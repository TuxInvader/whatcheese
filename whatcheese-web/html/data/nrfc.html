      <p>
        That's right the folks behind the technology that drives the worlds busiest websites (including this one), have released thier first cheese. The product in question is a rather squishy Brie with good mouth feel and notes of mushrooms and anchovie. The cheeky guys and girls at NGINX have named it "<strong>Brief Ncounter</strong>" due to it's limited availability, and mild laxative effects.

        Industry experts are quoted as saying that this cheese is just a rebranding of a Somerset cheese which was briefly sold in Tesco and Marks &amp; Sparks last year. The cheese was removed from the shelves following a health scare.

        Self proclaimed Cheese expert Sir George Cheddar of Wookey Hole commented "This is just another weird publicity stunt, after that disasterous N-Gin-X-Tonic debacle last year", and added "NGINX should stick to making world class Load Balancers, Polyglot Application Servers, and simplifying Service Mesh and Kubernetes! Leave the food and beverage making to people more qualified!".
